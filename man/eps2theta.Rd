\title{
Convert epsilon (permittivity) to theta (volumetric water content).
}
\description{
Convert epsilon (permittivity) to theta (volumetric water content) using different equations.
}
\usage{
eps2theta(epsdata, equation)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{epsdata}{
dataframe holding a column \code{epsilon} and potentially others, depending on the choice of \code{equation}.
}
  \item{equation}{
Equation to be used. Must be one of "deltaT_minorg", "FerschEtal2017", "ToppEtal1980", "MalickiEtal1996", "Jacobsen_Schjonning1993".
}
}
\details{
Applies various equations, most of which are listed in Mohamed & Paleologos, 2018: 

    

}
\value{
A vector of reals, i.e. theta (volumetric water content) [-].

For \code{equation=="list"}, a character vector of all supported equations is returned.
